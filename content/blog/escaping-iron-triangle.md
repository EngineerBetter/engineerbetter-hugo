We’ve recently been working with customers to help their IT leadership teams break out of the iron triangle of traditional project management thinking. Our aim has been to enable them to **understand their organisation as a system**, give them visibility of things that really matter and provide them with a new set of levers to manage things and measure progress.

## A familiar story

If you’ve worked in any organisation where the number of employees is measured in thousands you've probably experienced some common behavioural patterns and frustrations. Firstly it seems impossible to reach a decision; nobody can seem to agree on what the "right answer" is. Next, folks get upset because the plan keeps changing as new information is discovered, which has an impact on the mesh of internal commitments that got made based on the plan. Then when you look at progress during delivery of the plan, it’s obvious that everyone is really busy but it takes *so long* to get anything done.

## We're asking the wrong questions

To understand why we end up in this situation, we need to consider the lens through which business leaders traditionally view their organisations. We inherited our working methods from the industrial revolution but we never upgraded them for knowledge work in the 21st century. This means we’re usually stuck in a rut, asking questions about the three most *visible* aspects of our work:

1. What are we doing?
2. How much will it cost?
3. When will it be done?

When we’re trapped inside this triangle of thinking, all our management efforts actually tend to make things worse:

* We analyse and plan activities in detail, but always end up deviating from the plan. When this happens we try to plan in even more detail next time, assuming we must not have "captured" all the requirements.
* We try to control the costs of our resources, but somehow our total cost to deliver the same amount of actual business value keeps going up.
* We set clear timescales for our deliverables but never get what we hoped for in a reasonable amount of time. Then, while we’re stuck waiting for things to get done, we start more work in parallel.

It’s painful isn’t it? These methods have long proven themselves to be ineffective in situations  where we face a lot of uncertainty, yet we keep trying to use them.

At EngineerBetter we often discover that our customers have a management approach that creates friction, so we started using a number of techniques to help them get to a better place.

## Flow efficiency, not resource efficiency

When IT leadership teams have been tasked with reducing costs, helping them acquire knowledge of the organisation as a *system* can provide some much needed enlightenment. To make this visible we can use the lean-management technique of [Value Stream Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream_mapping) to map the way value actually gets delivered and understand the impediments to flow.

Imagine that enterprise IT is a very leaky water pump, but the people responsible for it aren't able to see the actual pump itself (i.e how the parts of the system interact). These folks don't see all the water that is gushing out onto the floor and going down the drain; they only see the poor performance - the disappointing trickle of output from the system - together with a bill of materials and costs for the parts.

If you can’t see the whole **system** and its problems, you'll likely try to optimise by making changes to what is visible to you. For example, you might assume that the way to achieve cost efficiency is to pay less for the parts, since you have no visibility of the leaks.

Once you understand the way in which value flows through your system you can begin to see where your money is really going. Usually this isn’t overspending on the parts of the system, but the shocking amount of waste we simply aren’t aware of. For example, when we looked at the software development value stream in one of our enterprise customers we found poor internal feedback loops meant that **40-50% of their capacity was being used for rework**. In other words, **half their payroll was literally being spent on creating and fixing defects**. They actually had a quality problem, not a spending problem.

## Communicating the direction of travel

Studying the system gives us appreciation of *flow* and visibility of where waste occurs in our system. One of the most common sources of waste is excessive planning and analysis. Usually a series of decisions and commitments become dependent on this plan, but it later ends up being irrelevant, as the world changes around us. How might we change the way we define our objectives, to cope with change and reduce this waste?

We often talk about defining **outcomes instead of outputs** when describing agility in senior leadership, but how is this done? Often folks have a shopping list of things to be done, but the intent behind them is poorly communicated. We’ve found that [Impact Mapping](https://www.impactmapping.org/) is a fast way to reverse engineer deliverables and solution ideas into business goals. This visual technique allows everyone in the room to quickly validate their deliverable ideas within the context of actual goals.

## Prioritising and measuring progress

If we can identify what business outcomes are *worth*, not just what they *cost*, we know how the value of these things is leaking away over time. This allows us to quickly make prioritisation and tradeoff decisions. The tool for quantifying business value is called [Cost of Delay](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/learning-cost-delay-cloud-foundry-boston-summit/). Like many Lean and Agile concepts, Cost of Delay helps facilitate a better quality of conversation. When we're forced to surface all our assumptions about *why* something is valuable, it allows everyone to examine these assumptions.

When you're expressing your ideas as measurable business outcomes, rather than specific deliverables, you enable the system to cope with uncertainty and iterate towards the solutions that will move the needle on these outcomes. Attaching metrics to goals allows teams to be measured in a far more meaningful way than whether they have delivered a particular set of features on time. When we communicate our intent behind an epic or story as a *hypothesis* to be tested we frame our roadmap as a runway of questions to be answered within a time window, instead of "scope" to be delivered by a deadline.

## Compatibility between management and development teams

All of these techniques contribute to a shift in thinking that alleviates the friction that commonly occurs between management and agile development teams. We’ve always aimed to help software teams **work on the most important things in the simplest possible way**, but by working with senior leaders in the above ways we can raise levels of mutual empathy and understanding.

If we reshape the internal commitments that are made and ultimately improve flow. No more broken promises about arbitrary scope that hasn’t been delivered on time - just sustainable, continuous delivery of the most valuable ideas, straight to end customers.
